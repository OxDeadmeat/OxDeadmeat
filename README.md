- 👋 My developer name is @OxDeadmeat. After 50 years of hardware/software/firmware development & support I retired in 2024.  I continue to tinker with tools I wrote and used for helping analyze io flow within Linux environments.
- 👀 I’m interested in io flow analysis within Linux and storage hardware.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning github
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on understanding io flow issues within the linux kernel, HBAs and various storage hardware.
- 📫 How to reach me TBD.
- 😄 Pronouns: jiibay
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first electronics class was vacuum tube theory. And yes, that means I used a slide rule in college.
